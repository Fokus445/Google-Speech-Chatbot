## Overview

This project builds a voice-powered chatbot using Google APIs and PyAudio for microphone stream and Pygame.mixer as a response player.

Here's how it works:

    Speech to Text: The user speaks a question or command. PyAudio captures the audio and converts it to text using Google Speech-to-Text API.
    Dialogflow Integration: The transcribed text is sent to Dialogflow ES, a natural language processing platform from Google. Dialogflow analyzes the intent and retrieves the appropriate response.
    Text to Speech: The response generated by Dialogflow is converted back to natural-sounding speech using Google Text-to-Speech API.
    Interactive Conversation: The synthesized speech is played back to the user using the Pygame music player, creating a real-time conversation experience.
